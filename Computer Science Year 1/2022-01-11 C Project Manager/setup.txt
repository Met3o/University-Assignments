Welcome to the project manager tool!
In order to use the tool, first run this command:

chmod u+x Makefile.sh
./Makefile.sh

After using this once, you can access the main commands:
-pmwrite
-pm
-pmgit
-Without having to use './'.

You may type 'pm instructions' to see the full list of commands. More may be added eventually.
