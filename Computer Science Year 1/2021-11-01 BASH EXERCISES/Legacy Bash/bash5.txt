Bash results for the Week 5 exercise.

NOTE: All steps will be listed, however results for simple commands like mkdir and ls will not be documented
in detail here as they already were fully in the previous bashes and it is obvious what they are going to
do at this point, unless I am experimenting with them to return a specified type of result. E.g. "cd portfolio"
is merely "Switch the current working directory to be /portfolio/" and doesn't need to be detailed.

1) cd ~

1b) cd portfolio

2) git switch master

3) git merge greeting

4) git merge vectors

5) git merge framework

extra1) (tree command installed)
Result: Displayed a tree list but some files and directories were missing, particularly week1. Will have to replace these later.

6) git branch baseconversion

Prediction: Create a baseconversion branch to store our code.
Actual: Success Later checking seems to detail that a baseconversion branch exists.

7) git switch baseconversion

8) mkdir week5 ; cd week5

9) make -f ../week4/framework/Makefile feature NAME=dec2bin

10) cd dec2bin

11) gcc src/conv.c -o lib/conv.o -c

12) ar rv lib/libconv.a lib/conv.o

13) gcc src/dec2bin.c -o bin/dec2bin -Isrc -lconv -Llib

14) ~/portfolio/week4/framework/test_output/src/test_outputs test/dec2bin_tests

15) cd ~

16) git switch master

17) git merge baseconversion

18) mkdir docs

19) doxygen -g

Prediction: Link to a doxygen API?
Actual: Initialised a lot of response lines.

20) git add doxyfile

21) commands used: "nano submission_answers.md"

22) commands used: "nano _Frontpage.md"

23) git add submission_answers.md

24) git add _Frontpage.md

25) git commit -m “added configured Doxyfile, answers and frontpage”

26) git push

27) doxygen

Result: Appeared to initialise a lot of response again.

28)  cd docs/latex

29) make

Prediction: Unsure, going to "make" something?
Actual: Executed a bunch of lines, and seems to have created refman.pdf.

30) git add refman.pdf

31) git commit -m “adding documentation”

32) git push
