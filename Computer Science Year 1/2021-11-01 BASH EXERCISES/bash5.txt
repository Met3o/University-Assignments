Bash results for the Week 5 exercise.

NOTE: All steps will be listed, however results for simple commands like mkdir and ls will not be documented
in detail here as they already were fully in the previous bashes and it is obvious what they are going to
do at this point, unless I am experimenting with them to return a specified type of result. E.g. "cd portfolio"
is merely "Switch the current working directory to be /portfolio/" and doesn't need to be detailed.

1) cd ~: Change to the top directory.

1b) cd portfolio: Switch to the portfolio directory and execute all subsequent commands relative from there.

2) git switch master: Switch to master.

3) git merge greeting: Merge with the greeting branch.

4) git merge vectors: Merge with the vectors branch.

5) git merge framework: Merge with the framework branch.

extra1) (tree command installed)
Result: Displayed a tree list but some files and directories were missing, particularly week1. Will have to replace these later.

6) git branch baseconversion: Create a baseconversion branch.

Prediction: Create a baseconversion branch to store our code.
Actual: Success Later checking seems to detail that a baseconversion branch exists.

7) git switch baseconversion: Switch to this branch.

8) mkdir week5 ; cd week5: Create and change to a directory called week5.

9) make -f ../week4/framework/Makefile feature NAME=dec2bin: Makefile generation

10) cd dec2bin: Switch to the dec2bin directory and execute all subsequent commands relative from there.

11) gcc src/conv.c -o lib/conv.o -c: Execute conv.c and store the object code in conv.o?

12) ar rv lib/libconv.a lib/conv.o: Unknown.

13) gcc src/dec2bin.c -o bin/dec2bin -Isrc -lconv -Llib: Execute?

14) ~/portfolio/week4/framework/test_output/src/test_outputs test/dec2bin_tests: Unknown, there seems to be no command here.

15) cd ~: Switch to the root directory.

16) git switch master: Switch working branch to the master branch.

17) git merge baseconversion: Merge with the baseconversion branch, including removing it after.

18) mkdir docs: Create a docs directory.

19) doxygen -g: Generate report?

Prediction: Link to a doxygen API?
Actual: Initialised a lot of response lines.

20) git add doxyfile: Add the doxyfile that was just made.

21) commands used: "nano submission_answers.md"

22) commands used: "nano _Frontpage.md"

23) git add submission_answers.md: Add submission_answers to the files that can be pushed to the repository.

24) git add _Frontpage.md: Add submission_answers to the files that can be pushed to the repository.

25) git commit -m “added configured Doxyfile, answers and frontpage”: Commit the changes under this heading.

26) git push: Push the changes, including added files.

27) doxygen

Result: Appeared to initialise a lot of response again.

28)  cd docs/latex

29) make

Prediction: Unsure, going to "make" something?
Actual: Executed a bunch of lines, and seems to have created refman.pdf.

30) git add refman.pdf: Add refman.pdf to the git repository.

31) git commit -m “adding documentation”: Commit the changes.

32) git push: Initialise the changes.
