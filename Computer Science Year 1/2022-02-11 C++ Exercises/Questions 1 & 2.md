Question 1:

Object oriented programming is a form of programming that relies heavily on uses of classes and subclasses to represent groups of functions and aspects, grouping variables and functions into individual blueprints, which are then used to create objects with their own information.
Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming where, under the existence of a parent class, a subclass has inherited the same methods as the parent class, but the nature of the method itself differs between the subclass and its parent, and potentially between multiple other subclasses inheriting that same method from the parent. This allows for uniform similarity, and flexibility, across the object instances of all of these, causing them to all exist in a comparable format. The parent class (also known as a base class) acts as a blueprint.
Different subclasses from the same basic template may overlap with some, or all the parent class’s functions, with multiple of them perhaps sharing the same set of these methods as a result. This is known as inheritance. 
However, a method that each subclass inherits might be altered from the same method in the parent class in some way, thus distinguishing a subclass from that parent template. This allows for subclasses to adjust their methods to a way that suits them. 
A simple illustration of this is the varying methods used to draw different shapes or features on paper; the same drawing tools (ink, paper, hand) are used for each different shape; “The routine used to draw an object varies according to the shape of the object–drawing a square is not the same process as drawing a circle. This customized interpretation of a message is known as polymorphism; the message is said to be polymorphic.”[1]
In this case, the “message” refers to the method of drawing out the shape on paper, likely to be called ‘draw()’ or ‘sketch()’, which happens in all cases of drawing. The parent class, “shape”, might have subclasses Circle{} and Square{} in this case, which are both shapes, but are drawn differently from each other.
